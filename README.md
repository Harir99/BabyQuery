    Each file contains 200 lines representing the top 200 names for male and female babies. The
format of each line is as follows:

John 89,950 Mary 91,668
[1] The first number is the rank, i.e. 1 means that these are the most popular male and
female names in the decade from 1880 to 1889.
[John 89,950] This is followed by the male baby name and then the number of babies
with that name born in the decade.
[Mary 91,668] The fourth item is the female baby name of rank 1, followed by the
number of babies with that name.
